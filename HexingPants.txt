This is my attempt at a Season 2 non-set based (meaning no 6-piece required or focused) Fire Hexing Pants build. Please note I am just a very casual player who plays more for theorycrafting rather than pushing GR ranks.

# Introduction
The idea of this build came around when Kadala gave me a decent pair of Hexing Pants while I was trying to roll for Rolands. I main Crusader, so I was trying to think of ways to use these pants without focusing on Akkhan's and/or stutterstepping. The first thought that came to mind was a Condemn build since it is one of the few spells that can be cast without stopping while running, this led to Frydehr's Wrath being required. While testing the build, running into enemies threw off my grove, which led to the need for Illusory Boots. 

Like I said before, I focus on theorycrafting builds that do not require sets. I don't mind being mediocre in terms of GR rank if I can just have fun trying new ideas. 

I will discuss the Legendary Gems below that synergize well with the build. 

If you want you can inspect [my profile](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/profile/woppels-1850/hero/57737715) here.

It's important to note that Hexing Pants are not necessarily required to attempt this build, but your damage output will be greatly affected without them. 

I will discuss the build in this order:

* Skill Setups
* Gear Setups
* Legendary Gems
* Paragon Points
* Playstyle and Tips

# 1. Skill setups
I am a huge fan of fire based skills on the Crusader and roll with a fire sader on ns. I love that you can stack fire like crazy and was hoping to reflect this using these pants and Frydehr's wrath. The Belt of the Trove is just a bonus since it's free Bombardments every 6-8 seconds and it is buffed by all of your %fire damage. 

What you want to focus on for skills for this is: 

* Akarat's Champion - Prophet
* Laws of Justice - Immovable Object OR Laws of Valor - Unstoppable Force
* Condemn - Reciprocate
* Provoke - Cleanse
* Shield Glare - Zealous Glare
* Bombardment - Annihilate (if you have Belt of the Trove) / Free Slot

and the passives (with Hellfire Amulet):

* Finery
* Indestructible
* Holy Cause
* Heavenly Strength
* Long Arm of the Law

##Active Skills
###Akarat's Champion - Prophet

This is pretty self-explanatory. With the Illusory Boots you're going to be running INTO mobs to best utilize Condemn. Prophet increases your toughness and gives you a second life with each activation. 

###Laws of Justice - Immovable Object OR Laws of Valor - Unstoppable Force

Right now I am using Laws of Justice to buff my Toughness, but if you are a bit more reckless Laws of Valor is a valid choice as well. If you feel your Toughess is lacking, roll with Justice, otherwise Valor should be fine. Long Arm of the Law will help in either case. 

###Condemn - Reciprocate

This is your bread and butter. I chose the Reciprocate rune because this is a fire build and your main spender should be fire based. This build may be tweaked for a Physical variant (so that Vacuum may be used), but I have not yet seriously thought of that yet. A small bonus is that since you're running into mobs to do the damage with the Illusory Boots, Reciprocate should do some extra damage. 


###Provoke

Provoke is absolutely necessary for maintaining your Wrath. I found for greedy DPS, Charged Up is useful, but for healing Cleanse is your best bet. If you find yourself dying too often or running low on health, Cleanse is your best option. Otherwise, if you feel safe, go with Charged Up. 

###Shield Glare - Zealous Glare

This is another way to maintain your Wrath and have some sort of crowd control. The Zealous Glare rune helps with Wrath if you are starved. 

###Bombardment - Annihilate /  Generator

If you have Belt of the Trove, Bombardment is good for dealing with pesky enemies who like to run away or for times between Condemn casting. It also helps a great deal with RGs and trash. One of the issues with this build is with single target damage during times of low Wrath. The Annihilate rune is essential as it has guaranteed crits. 

If you **do not** have belt of the trove, a generator will probably be your best choice. Even though your damage will be decreased by Hexing Pants while generating Wrath, you will still be generating wrath. 

Personally I use Punish - Roar as a generator. If you feel you need more armor/toughness while building Wrath, use Slash - Guard.

##Passive Skills
Passive skills are fairly self-explanatory, so I will not go too much in-depth, however it should be noted that a *Hellfire Amulet* is in my opinion the strongest option in an amulet slot, five passives for a Crusader is invaluable.

###Indestructible

Easy choice for use in tandem with Akarat - Prophet. 


###Finery

Since we'll be using three legendary gems with this build (ideally), Finery is a great choice. 

###Holy Cause

10% damage boost. (I am DPS greedy). 

###Heavenly Strength

Absolutely necessary for this build. You need 2H + Shield for this to work. 

###Long Arm of the Law

I prioritize this last as I have not yet focused on crafting Hellfire Amulets, but this is an important skill for you if you have Wrath issues or Toughness issues (if using Laws of Jusice). 



## 2. Gear Setups
The optimal setup for this build would be: 

* Head: Andariel's Visage
* Shoulders: Ancient Craftable Shoulders
* Chest: Cindercoat
* Gloves: Magefist
* Bracers: Reaper Wraps
* Belt: Belt of the Trove
* Pants: Hexing Pants of Mr. Yan
* Rings: Unity & SoJ (or Focus/Restraint)
* Amulet: Hellfire
* Weapon: Blade of Prophecy
* Shield: Frydehr's Wrath

For this setup, we are stacking all of the fire we can get (aside from BoP). 

Let's talk about gear priorities. 

##Priorities

###Regular Gems

If you are worried about survivability, switch out Rubies in your pants for Diamonds. 

**Helm**

Primary: % Fire > Crit Chance > STR > Vit/All Res > IAS

Comment on IAS: Since you're only casting Condemn, IAS is not needed. 

**Shoulders**

Primary: STR > % Condemn Damage > CDR > Vit/All Res

Comment: Not sure about CDR and Vit/All Res, focus mostly on Primary and Condemn. 

**Gloves**

Primary: STR > Crit Damage > Crit Chance > CDR

Comment: Again, no need for IAS. 

**Chest**

Primary: 3 sockets &gt; STR &gt; Condemn Damage% &gt; Vitality


**Pants**

Primary: 2 sockets &gt; STR &gt; Vit &gt; All Res/Life per Second


**Boots**

Primary: STR &gt; Vit &gt; All Res &gt; Life per Second &gt; Movement Speed &gt; Armor

Secondary: Secondary Resist

**Rings**

Primary: Socket &gt; CDR &gt; %Fire Damage &gt; Crit Damage &gt; Crit Chance &gt; Strength &gt; Attack Speed

Secondary: Secondary Resist

**Belt**

Primary: Crit Damage (Witching Hour) > STR > Vit > All Res > %Life > IAS

Secondary: Secondary Resistance, Life after Kill

**Bracers**

Primary: %Fire Damage &gt; STR &gt; Crit &gt; Legendary Affix &gt; Vit

Secondary: Damage Reduction % &gt; Secondary Resist

**Amulet**

Primary: Socket &gt; Crit Damage &gt; Crit Chance &gt; Holy %Damage &gt; STR

Secondary: Legendary Affix &gt; Secondary Resist

**Weapon**

Primary: STR > %Damage > Damage Range

Secondary: Life after Kill 

**Shield**

Primary: Crit Chance &gt; STR &gt; %Condemn Damage &gt; > Elite Dmg > Vit

Secondary: %Damage Reduction &gt; Secondary Resist

## 3. Legendary Gems

These are the three you want to prioritize:

* Bane of the Trapped
* Bane of the Powerful
* Esoteric Alteration 

For Season 3 I will be prioritizing Mutilation Guard over Esoteric Alteration just to try it out. However, with the ease of movement granted by Illusory Boots, I will probably not worry about it too much. 

####Bane of the Trapped
Since you will be in the middle of enemies constantly, BoT is absolutely essential. Your Condemn explosion and the range of the movement debuff from Level 25 BoT go hand in hand. 

#### Bane of the Powerful
Again, I'm a big numbers guy, so this is great for taking down elites with the bonus elite damage and the buff you get after killing a pack. 

#### Esoteric Alteration
One of the ways I am thinking of mitigating damage while amongst enemies. I hope to try the Mutilation Guard in Season 3 once it is released since it focuses more on Melee damage than Non-Physical damage; level 25 Mutilation is not a priority due to Illusory Boots.  I have not yet leveled my Esoteric to 25, but am working on it. 

## Paragon Points
**Paragon Priorities**
Top-to-bottom are your highest to your lowest priorities per category.

Core|Offense|Defense|Utility
:--|:--|:--|:--
Strength|Crit Damage|Resist All|Area Damage
Movement Speed|Crit Chance|Life|Resource Cost Reduction
Vitality|Cooldown Reduction|Armor|Life on Hit
Maximum Wrath|Attack Speed|Life per Second|Gold Find


####Core
Dump as many points as needed into Movement to reach 25% and then the rest into STR. 
####Offense
Max out in this order: Crit Damage > Crit Chance > CDR > IAS
####Defense
Max out in this order: Resist All &gt; Life% &gt; Armor &gt; Life Regeneration
####Utility
Max out everything in the following order: Area Damage &gt; RCR &gt; Life on Hit &gt; Gold Find

## 4. Playstyle and Tips
The most important part in playing a Condemn Crusader boils down to this:


* Movement
* Condemn Cast Timing 
* Wrath Management

###**Movement**
With Illusory Boots you will constantly be running into mobs to to your damage. There is nothing to worry about other than movement impairment affixes from Elite packs. 

###**Condemn Cast Timing**

**Frydehr's Wrath** removes the cooldown of Condemn. However, it has an internal cooldown of about 0.5-0.6 seconds. For maxing out damage, you have to be able to gauge when to start casting Condemn and when to run into mobs for the explosion. Another issue to worry about is with Elite affixes that can stop you from getting to them with your explosion. Knockback + Mortar is one of the most annoying affixes to see on a pack. 

**Elite Packs**

If the pack is melee based and the affixes are not terrible, then I would suggest going in to kill them. Packs with "runner" enemies or ranged enemies are not worth your time. 

With yellow packs I would not suggest it unless they are melee / have a shallow healthpool. Even with **Belt of the Trove**, your single target still is not fantastic in this build. 


###**Rifts**
RGs I hate running into: 

* Tethrys
* Blighter (unless you're running Mara's Kaleidoscope)
* Sandshaper
* Rime
* Erethon
* Anyone with Knockback / Movement impairment

It's a nuisance to be knocked away and slowed while you have your Condemn charging. I am still looking for better Krelm's to deal with this. 

### Ending
That's it. If you want to tear this apart or have any questions let me know. 

Indirect thanks to /u/Epixors for his sick formatting skills. 

If you want to debate me not liking to use sets that's fine too. ^but ^dont ^be ^too ^mean ^:C

TL;DR: Casual theorycrafter fire build.
